//! This module contains implementation of the price finding algorithm for
//! providing price estimates to the solver.
//!
//! This algorithm works by reducing ring trades (i.e. negative cycles) in the
//! orderbook and computing a price vector for that cycle. For each token, the
//! last discovered price is used as the price estimate. The last price is used
//! to ensure that the estimate is closest to the intersection point of the
//! orderbook graph in the market the trade was on.
